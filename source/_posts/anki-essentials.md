### Motivation
'Anki' is, so far, my favorite app for [spaced-repetition memorization](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition). I've used it for 3 years straight, almost every single day, both on laptop and my purchased iPhone app. It's the best time investment I've made in my knowledge life. Wondered a million times before: what if I had it in college, life would be insanely easy.... ;)
Although a big fan, there are many corners of the software I still don't know about, and 'Anki Essentials' came to rescue.

### User guide rather than App documentation
This 120 pages long pdf is by far the best comprehensive user guide I've found for Anki. We sure get a decent document for the app itself, well maintained [here](http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html). However it doesn't serve the purpose for explaining the power of Anki to a beginner. And I think this is where the best value comes. As a frequent user, I also find various tips about making Notes and Cards; as well as various ideas about getting Anki study sessions more effective. 

### Background and 'the 20 rules'
A lot of pitfalls for using flash cards boil down to poorly made notes. As for me, the biggest take-home points are:
- Customize the notes at the sweet spot, Anki decks are extensions of building **personal** knowledge.
- Follow the best practices in authoring flash cards, best resource on Internet is ['the 20 rules'](http://yubinbai.com/2016/03/effective-learning/) developed in the 90s.

### Follow-up
Currently experimenting with image cloze deletion notes making. Hopefully this will help in understanding design patterns and learning patter diagrams.
