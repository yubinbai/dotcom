If you have a big job interview coming up and you know the name of the person conducting the interview, consider spending a few minutes stalking that person online so you can find hobbies or clubs shared in commonâ€”finding a connection that you can bring up during the interview will help help you stand out amongst the other candidates.

Financial weblog Free Money Finance lists several methods to encourage an interviewer to like you. They posit that the general rule of thumb with online stalking is that anything listed on LinkedIn is okay to use for conversation starters but you want to stay away from Facebook revelations as they can be more private and/or awkward. Since most of is posted on LinkedIn is generally considered public knowledge, you should be able to reference information about the company and that specific employee without giving off the creepy stalker vibe.
