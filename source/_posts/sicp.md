A must-read for basics to computation theory. I encountered this book 2 years ago, not really knowing much about the evolution of computer languages, hardward architecture. At that time, took it up and throw it away after a few minutes, thought it's totally worthless for starting a developer career. 

As time flies by, the longer I've been a developer, the more I feel the real growth comes from the understanding of fundamentals. How productive a haster hackers can be is only limited by the depth of the knowledge about profession, and all the craftsmanship gained along the way. This book allows me to go one level deeper to understand what code is meant for.
