Stumbled upon what tools to use for topcoder SRM matches last night. And havenâ€™t got a good solution yet.

IntelliJ IDEA IDE is pretty functional complete, however starts too slow, and need to learn a whole bunch of key maps.

Sublime will be more comfortable at the moment. However will be very lacking in the help of a good debugger.

Plan for now:

1. Continue use Sublime as main editor.

2. Search for a good plugin for Topcoder that generates test cases.

3. Edit code in sublime, and use IDEA as only a debugger.

4. Use git to manage code.
