Overall
===
Bible of JavaScript, the best reference book you can have. David Flanagan is [such a famous tech writer](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/156) that it's very difficult to complain about his writing. Interestingly, there's heated request for him to write the 7th edition and cover ECMAScript 6.

Where it shines
===
The book is very comprehensive and it aims for the only book you will need for all language features. One has to be careful not to read the book from start to end. If you do that, you're probably using it the wrong way.

Particularly, the important of object and function cannot be overemphasized. Readers could pay close attention to those as I think it would be useful for professionals at all levels.
