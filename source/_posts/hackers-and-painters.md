Overall
---
As the preface of the book says, 'This book is an attempt to explain to the world at large what goes on in the world of computers.' `Hackers and Painters` really tries to answer a lot of non-technical questions in a technical way.

Hackers are Makers
---
- Hackers are not cold and precise, they are messy. Hackers need taste.
- The 'computer science' terminology is mostly a hodge-podge.

Measurement and Leverage
---
- Measurement is needed for transforming work into impact
- Technology is leverage

The Hundred Year Language
---
- Modern languages are adopting more and more layers of in-directions
- Newer languages will be easier for human to reason about
- More of future CPU cycles are going to be used for building abstractions
