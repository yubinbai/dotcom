Overall
===
'Code Complete' is the very first book I've read about software engineering topic. This is a huge book of 900 pages!. From the 35 chapters, the most meaningful point I've discovered is the analogy between software engineering and **construction engineering**, where a piece of useful software is generated much of the same way as a physical building is completed.

Plan, Design, Implementation, Monitoring, Testing,  Delivery. Although software is most of a creative product, it still needs a good amount of tedious routine work to become a useful product. Much like a modern skyscraper, maintenance is a major part of software cost and must be considered at the very first step of software planning and requirement specification.

Verdict
===
Although new organization ideas are getting invented all the time, 'Code complete' is a must-read classics. It also has huge influence in academia as well, recommended to any software professional.
