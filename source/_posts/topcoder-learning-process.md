Started Github repo back in March, picking up speed lately: [Github repo](https://github.com/baiyubin/topcoder-srm)

Starting from latest SRM (single round match) 628, finished 30 total match in DIV 2 so far.

250 pt questions take 5-10 mins, 500 pt questions will take 1-4 hours mostly. And 1000 pts questions usually take days and I cannot solve most of them :( In total, about 3-4 SRMs per week.

To the bright side, each question I cannot solve myself, I can learn a lot from it. And it’s great to have other coders’ solutions ready for view in Topcoder Java Applet. Lots and lots of new discoveries, extremely beneficial. The only downside is their naming conventions are usually terrible. Considering they are doing it for contest, it’s somewhat reasonable.
