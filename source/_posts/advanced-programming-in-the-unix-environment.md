Overall
===
A very good introduction to UNIX system fundamentals, a classic system engineer textbook. Providing a lot of background with easy hands-on code examples.

Best part, the book is extremely practical, while also explaining many variations among unix, linux and macos.

Finished the book with various chapters in the second half skipped. They are mostly about highly specific system level features which I don't think urgent to learn.
