Overall
===

Though named a 'manual', it's actually a very good textbook for the introduction of algorithms class.

In the first half of the book, the author gives a very good overview of all the types of algorithm questions for a student's angle. And it clearly states the book's focus--combinatorial problems. The most value in the book comes from the second half, where it lays out the different types of problems and useful resources. Particularly useful to a less experienced software engineer, all problems the book describe have book references and implementations available in link.

Definitely worth reading a second time, and keep it close by hand! More, a lot of exercises have solutions here: [http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/Main_Page](http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/Main_Page)
