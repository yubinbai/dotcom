Overall
===
An old book, and mostly a descriptive document, highly recommended to Web developers. You can definitely find everything in here from Wikipedia, however this book saves you all the time finding what you need about HTTP.

Figures in the book are actually very good. Worth going through in a separate pass.

1/3/2015 Finished reading it. All notes taken to anki.
