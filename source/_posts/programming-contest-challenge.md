Yet another programming contest textbook. I've seen a good part of all the techniques. Still worth going through it for various applications to Peking Univ online judge and Google Codejam problems.

The techniques mentioned here are very much tailored to the needs of programming contests. Some of which require quite a bit of background and may not sounds useful for most developers. The true value of these are actually expand the horizon of Computer Science knowledge. It's not necessary to implement all of those, however very helpful to understand the process of problem solving.

This book is very suitable for medium level programmers. More, authors use C++ as default language which helps one to get familiar with a lot of the language quirks.
