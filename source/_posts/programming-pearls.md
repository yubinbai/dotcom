Overall
===
A guide on entry-level algorithms. Topics covered in this book have a very practical focus. Author delivers important concepts from a problem-solving perspective, and really drives the formulation of process.

In my opinion this is exactly how this book come to life from a series of column articles and remains a classics until now.

Though examples are quite outdated (consider the book is done in the 80s!), program design principles have not changed much. Readers need to be aware the deficiencies described in the book does not align with today's compilers and hardware stack.
