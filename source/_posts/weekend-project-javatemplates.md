Initiative: My code templates for contest programming spread among different projects and folders in Dropbox. Itâ€™s rather inconvenient to find and reuse, also this would generate duplicates.

Solution: Init git repository to hold all my Java code templates for contest programming.

When in particular contest, put this git repo as submodule into the current git repo for specific contests.

Use case will be easy accessible by the fuzzy search from sublime text.
